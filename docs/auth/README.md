# Authentication system

This section works with tables: ``external_user`` and ``internal_user``.

```
Option card:

User Authentication

1. Precondition: The user has registered and is in the table of external or internal users
2. Guarantee: an external user has registered and gained access to the user menu, an internal one - to the role
3. Minimum guarantee: the system has reported an unauthorized authorization, the user must enter the password again or log out
```

```
End User Scenario:

1. The user starts the authentication process
2. The system sends a form for login and password
3. The user enters the login and password for access
4. The system opens access that corresponds to its role

Exceptions:
- the user entered an incorrect username and password or did not enter them â†’ item 2.

The user can log in *(as internal or external)* or register *(only as external)*. 
If the user enters incorrect data the system will send an error message (red toast).
